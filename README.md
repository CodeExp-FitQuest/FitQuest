# FitQuest
FitQuest is a gamified fitness app designed to motivate and engage military personnel in Singapore on their fitness journey. 
It aims to address the challenge of the lack of motivation to stay fit by offering a fun and rewarding fitness experience.

## Context
Military personnel of Singapore have to go through an annual physical test known as the Individual Physical Proficiency Test (IPPT) to ensure the
fitness of the soldiers. IPPT uses 3 metrics to determine ones fitness which include the running time for 2.4km together with the number of 
push up and sit up.

## Problem
In 2014, it has been shown that 7 in 10 national service (NS) men in their 30s failed their IPPT.
The government attempted to fix this issue by implementing monetary incentive to motivate the servicemen to pass their IPPT.

| Award type | Incentive |
| ---------- | --------- |
| Gold | $500 |
| Silver | $300 |
| Pass with incentive | $200 |

While this helped to improve IPPT passing rate, military personnel now only trains just before the test for the reward and idle for the rest of the year.
This is an issue as servicemen should remain physically fit consistently throughout the year to be ready for any threats.

## Solution
FitQuest attempts to break down the challenge of IPPT and its monetary reward into smaller objectives with incentives proportional to their difficulties that are achievable throughout the year.
Users start off with an easy challenge for a minimal reward, say 10 push ups, 10 sit ups, and finish a 2.4km run in under 15 minutes for a reward of $50. 
He levels up if he completes these tasks. For the next month, the challenge increases in difficult and so does the reward. This approach not only makes fitness fun but also 
consistent and progressive where military personnel can be rewarded for staying fit.

## Key Features
- Milestones and Challenges: Users can take on various challenges, including running time, sit-up counts, and push-up counts to complete milestones.
- Flexible training: The application uses geolocation tracking and artificial intelligence to determine running time, sit-up counts, and push-up counts.
This means that challenges can be completed not just at the track and gym but at your local neighborhood and home as well.
- Level Progression and Rewards: As users improve their fitness performance, they advance through different levels within the app,
unlocking exclusive rewards and earning money based on specific level tiers.
